Why is Car Maintenance Important?
    </p>
Vehicle Maintenance is not only important but it is imperative to the longevity, value, and performance of your vehicle. A properly maintained vehicle not only doesn’t break down unexpectedly but also saves you money by avoiding costly auto repairs due to neglect. Something as simple as failing to change your oil can damage your engine: or not replacing brake pads could cause a wreck. Your vehicle is a complicated machine that needs to be monitored regularly to maintain reliability and performance. Additionally, it helps to preserve the resale value and increase fuel efficiency.
<p>
Personalized Vehicle Maintenance
            </p>
No two cars or drivers are the same. Mobile House takes that into consideration. Whether you are driving in the city, on the highway, or out the country it all makes a difference in how you maintain your vehicle. Stop and go driving requires not only more frequent engine and transmission service, but also brake maintenance and repair. Driving on the highway is less stressful on your car as a whole and can help reduce repairs over time. We take the time to get to know our customers and make sure their vehicles are getting the car maintenance and service it needs. Our goal is to keep your car out of the repair shop and on the road where it should be. One of our maintenance specialists can create a personalized vehicle maintenance program that will not only save you time but money.

Your vehicle’s wheel alignment is a service that all vehicles will eventually need.

So, the moment you drive your vehicle off the dealer’s lot you should be aware of the wheel alignment. It can be severely impacted by collisions with potholes and curbs. Whether this collision makes the vehicle undrivable or not, it will only speed up the misalignment process.

Protect and Preserve Your Tires

    <h2>Balancing</h2>
        <div class="lock">
            <img src="resources/images/riepu-balansesana-min.jpg" alt="services">
    <p>The Importance of Tyre Balancing</p>
You will need tyre balancing as soon as you purchase new tyres for your vehicle. This process is performed in order to ensure that all of the tyres are balanced with the wheel weights to ensure the smooth running of each of the tyres. When there is an imbalance in your tyres, the steering wheel will rock back and forth as you drive, especially when you drive at a certain speed. When you notice this happening, you should contact us to fix the problem straight away as it can be very dangerous to drive with imbalanced tyres.
<p>How to tell you need balancing</p>
You will be able to tell that your tyres are not balanced when certain tyres are wearing at a faster rate than others. This means that your tyres are imbalanced and you will need to correct this as soon as possible. It is importance that all of your tyres are balanced as when they are not, you will start to feel vibrations when travelling at certain speeds and this is very dangerous for the driver and its passengers. These vibrations also result in stress being created in the lower ball joints, axles and other essential parts of the vehicle. This increased stress on these parts will lead to them wearing at a faster rate and will mean you will have to replace these parts a lot sooner than you would have had to with balanced tyres.

Unbalanced tyres will also result in an increase in the tyre wear. This is because to compensate for the added stress on the tyres that the imbalance has created, the tyres start to wear from the edges, whereas with balanced tyres, they will wear from the middle. When this occurs, it will mean that you will have to change your tyres as they will no longer provide you with the necessary grip to drive safely.

<p>Schedule Your Balancing With Us!</p>
So when you notice that either your wheels are not aligned correctly or an imbalance with your tyres, ensure that you you should call us immediately. We would be of service. Give us a call today at +2348035910629 to schedule an appointment. You can use our contact system right now to save time. Next time you’re in the Gwarinpa Road–feel free to stop by with any questions or concerns. We gladly accept our walk-in customers!  as it will result in an increase in excessive tyre wear and more importantly but yours and others safety at risk.
